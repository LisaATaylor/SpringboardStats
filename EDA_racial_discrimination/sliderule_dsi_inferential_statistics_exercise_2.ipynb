    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",
    "   2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?\n",
    "   3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value. Try using both the bootstrapping and the frequentist statistical approaches.\n",
    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "<p> For this assignment, we were presented with a dataset of records corresponding to individual resumes.  This dataset was derived from a research study designed to infer whether there was evidence of racial bias in the rate of callbacks from employers when reviewing resumes.  The resumes were randomly assigned black and white-sounding names, and the presence of a callback was recorded in a 'call' field, with a value of 1 indicating the applicant received a callback and 0 indicating no callback occurred. </p>\n",
    "   <p>Callback rates of 6.4% and 9.7% were observed for the black and white resumes, respectively.  To evaluate whether the difference between these rates was statistically significant, we performed a hypothesis test for difference in proportion of callbacks between races using both frequentist (i.e. z-score) and bootstrapping techniques.  Both methods produced very low p-values, suggesting that the observed difference in callback rate was not a chance occurrence, but rather evidence of a real difference in callback rates between the white and black resume groups.  The results of a chi-square test also verified that the callback rates were dependent on the race assigned to a resume in this study.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "    <p>Although these results demonstrate that applicant race affects the likelihood of getting a callback, this does not mean it is the only factor that influences an employer's decision. We assume that the original investigators controlled for other resume items (such as skills, years of experience, type of education, etc.) to prevent these factors from biasing the experiment.  If these factors were included in our analysis, we could evaluate the relative influence of race in the context of these other elements to infer the most important factors influencing employer response.  </p>\n",
